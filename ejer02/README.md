# Angular 2 basic example

Taken from the [original documentation site](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/webpack.html)

Couple of things weren't included in the tutorial:

- Add angular.png in the public/images folder
- Install and import reflect-metadata as dev dependency

# Notes:

- I'm including typings folder in the repo. Check [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37372698/should-git-track-the-typings-folder-typings-json)
